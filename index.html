<p class="mensaje mensaje-cumple">
Today is not just the day you were born, it’s the day the world was blessed with someone incredibly special… someone who would later become my everything. Even though we’ve known each other for only three months, what I feel for you is deeper than time can measure. Loving you has felt natural, intense, and undeniable, as if my heart recognized yours long before we ever met.

Being in a long-distance relationship isn’t easy, but loving you makes every mile worth it. Every message, every call, every moment we share — even through a screen — reminds me that real love doesn’t depend on distance, but on connection. And ours is real. Strong. Pure. Unbreakable.

You came into my life unexpectedly, and somehow you changed everything. You brought light into my days, peace into my heart, and meaning into my future. You are the person I think about when I wake up and the last thought in my mind before I sleep. No matter what happens, no matter what challenges life puts in front of us, I want you to know this: you are everything to me.

I admire you more than words can express — your strength, your heart, your beauty inside and out. You inspire me to be better, to love deeper, and to believe in something bigger than myself. Loving you is one of the best things that has ever happened to me, and I don’t take that lightly.

On your birthday, I wish I could be there to hold you, to look into your eyes, and to remind you in person how loved you are. But until that moment comes, I hope you feel my love in every word, every thought, and every beat of my heart that belongs to you.

Happy Birthday, my beautiful love. Thank you for existing, thank you for choosing me, and thank you for being you. No matter what the future holds, I choose you — today, tomorrow, and always.

I love you more than distance, more than time, more than anything. 💖
